## 2. Changes by roadmap item

<!-- Repeat the entire 2.x block for each roadmap item listed in section 1 -->

### 2.x [ROADMAP-ID] - [Roadmap title]

**A. TL;DR (1–2 sentences)**  
- [Plain-English summary of the changes for this roadmap item]

**B. 5W + H**

- **What changed:**  
  [Concrete behavior/functionality that changed. Focus on outcomes, not file names.]

- **Why it changed:**  
  [Problem, requirement, bug, or technical debt this addresses. Include links to tickets if useful.]

- **How it changed:**  
  [High-level implementation approach. Mention patterns, new APIs, notable refactors, but avoid wall-of-text.]

- **Where it changed:**  
  [Key modules/components/files/functions. Do not list every file, only the important ones.]

- **When (roadmap):**  
  [Roadmap phase/milestone this contributes to, and whether this is partial or complete for that item.]

**C. Touch points & citations**

<!-- Map each meaningful change hunk to files and line ranges.
     Prefer git diff with --unified=0 so line ranges are clear. -->

- `path/to/FileA.ext`: L[start]–[end] -> [Short description of what changed there]
- `path/to/FileB.ext`: L[start]–[end] -> [Short description]
- `path/to/FileC.ext`: L?–? (TBD) -> [If line range not clearly derivable; fix manually later]

**D. Tests & verification**

  - [Added/Updated/None]  
  - [List key test files or test case names, if applicable]

- **Manual verification:**  
  - [Environment: e.g. local, staging]

- **Potential impact if broken:**  
  - [Impact 1]
  - [Impact 2]

- **Rollback plan:**  
  - [How to revert (e.g. revert PR #NNN) or disable via feature flag]
  - [Any data migrations or config changes that need reversal]

## 3. Cross-cutting changes (if any)

<!-- Use this section for changes not specific to a single roadmap item:
     e.g. linting, renames, mechanical refactors, tooling updates. -->

- **Type:** [e.g. "Mechanical refactor", "Lint cleanup", "Tooling update"]
- **Scope:** [Which areas of the codebase are affected]
- **Rationale:** [Why this is in this PR instead of a separate one]
- **Touch points (optional):**
  - `path/to/FileX.ext`: L[start]–[end] -> [Short description]
  - `path/to/FileY.ext`: L[start]–[end] -> [Short description]

## 4. Implementation notes for reviewers (optional)

<!-- Use this section to direct reviewers to tricky or high-signal areas. -->

- [Mention any areas where you specifically want feedback]
- [Note any temporary workarounds or TODOs that are intentional]
